# Chess
Code and implementation for a text-based chess game 
Hello, and welcome to my chess game. Here are a few instructions in order to operate a game. 
The input is the initial position of the piece you are dealing with, while the next scanner input will be the result move. 
For example, if I type in a2 c3, this means that I am trying to move the piece at a2 to the c3 position. If this move is
valid, then the game proceeds to the opposing player's move. If not, you will be asked to try again until a valid move has worked.
